decision


In appeal against the decision/order dated 30.06.2008 passed by the learned District Commissioner, Kanpur Nagar in Complaint No. 337/2003, Munnalal Dhobi and others vs. Kanpur Development Authority, the appellant

Heard Mr. Piyush Mani Tripathi, learned counsel for the plaintiff and Mr. Umesh Kumar Srivastava, learned counsel for the respondent. The impugned judgment, order, and file were perused. The District Consumer Commission directed the complainants to seek relief within 30 days.

An order has been passed to register the allotted buildings in favour of the company at the amount payable at the time of allotment. Alternatively, it has been directed that in case of non-compliance of the order, simple interest at the rate of 18 per cent should be paid on the deposited amount.

The learned counsel appearing for the Authority accepts the fact that seven buildings were allotted in favour of all the complainants.
During the arguments, the learned counsel for the respondents argued that this order

In compliance with this, a sale deed has been executed in favor of the six complainants.

Copies of the sale deed have also been made available for perusal.

Hence, since
a sale deed has been executed in favor of the complainants, this sale deed remains

It was executed after receiving the amount. Therefore, it is appropriate to dispose of this appeal in such a manner that the sale deeds were executed in favour of the six allottees after depositing the amount on the terms and at the rates mentioned above.

The sale deed should be executed by collecting money from the remaining allottees at the same rate.

Therefore, the appeal is disposed of as above.
If any amount has been deposited by the appellant in the appeal, the said amount, along with accrued interest, shall be returned to the District Consumer Commission.

It should be sent for disposal as per law as soon as possible.

The Stenographer is expected to upload this decision and order on the Commission's website as soon as possible as per rules.
